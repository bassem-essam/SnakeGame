# SnakeGame

A Snake game implementation demonstrating Clean Architecture principles using ASP.NET Core.

This project focuses on architecture rather than complex gameplay, showcasing:
- Separation of concerns
- SOLID principles in practice
- Selective application of domain-driven design concepts
- Interface-based dependencies
- Testing capabilities

Built from scratch as a learning tool rather than a traditional web or enterprise application.
